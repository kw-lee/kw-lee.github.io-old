## Korean Speech Recognition Using Deep Learning

We proposed an end-to-end deep learning model combining Bayesian neural network with Korean speech recognition. In the past, Korean speech recognition was a complicated task due to the excessive parameters of many intermediate steps and needs for Korean expertise knowledge. Fortunately, Korean speech recognition becomes manageable with the aid of recent breakthroughs in “End-to-end” model. The end-to-end model decodes MFCC directly as text without any intermediate processes. Especially, Connectionist Temporal Classiﬁcation loss and Attention based model are a kind of the end-to-end. In addition, we combined Bayesian neural network to implement the end-to-end model and obtain Monte Carlo estimates. We carry out experiments on the “WorimalSam” online dictionary dataset.
